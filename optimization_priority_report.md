- ‚è≥ **data_cleanup**: Implement periodic cleanup of expired data
- ‚è≥ **selective_monitoring**: Monitor only critical performance metrics
## ‚ö° High Priority Optimizations
- ‚è≥ **prompt_caching** (llm_optimization)  - Implement caching for common prompts to reduce LLM calls  - Impact: major, Effort: medium
- ‚è≥ **batch_processing** (llm_optimization)  - Batch multiple LLM requests to reduce API overhead  - Impact: major, Effort: hard
- ‚è≥ **model_selection** (llm_optimization)  - Use smaller/faster models for simple decisions  - Impact: major, Effort: medium
- ‚è≥ **parallel_processing** (llm_optimization)  - Process multiple agents in parallel  - Impact: major, Effort: hard
- ‚è≥ **fast_path** (action_parsing)  - Implement fast path for most common actions  - Impact: major, Effort: medium
- ‚è≥ **differential_updates** (state_management)  - Only update changed state properties  - Impact: major, Effort: medium
- ‚úÖ **history_limits** (memory_optimization)  - Limit length of historical data kept in memory  - Impact: major, Effort: easy  - Notes: Limited history to 1000 items
