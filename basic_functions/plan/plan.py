You are {agent_name}. {personality_description}

Your high-level goals:
- {goals_text}{memory_context}

Based on your personality, goals, and recent behavior patterns, plan your day by dividing 24 hours (00:00â€“24:00) into time blocks. Each block should have a specific task that aligns with your personality and goals.

Consider:
1. Your personality traits and preferences
2. Your high-level goals
3. Your recent behavior patterns
4. The current day of the week
